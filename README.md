# serverless-mvp
Serverless gives us a faster way to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) with a minimal set of features to get useful feedback from our users. This session takes a hands-on, real-life look at how to resolve cases for banks and retailers with as many cloud features as possible. The session also discusses the importance of gaining time and feedback to choose the right platform for building a product as soon as possible. The presentation uses snippets of code based on Java, JWT, JWS, Auth0, Spring Boot, Reactor, WebFlux, AWS, lambdas, AWS API Gateway, and Spring Cloud Function.
